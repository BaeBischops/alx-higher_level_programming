<h1>0x00 Python Hello World</h1>


In this undertaking, I started honing my skills with the Python interpreter, printing both text and variables, and exploring string indexing and slicing techniques.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<h5>0. Run Python File</h5>
<code>0-run:</code>
This Shell script is designed to execute a Python script, with the file name specified in the environment variable $PYFILE. It checks whether the environment variable is set, verifies if the specified Python file exists, and then runs the Python script using the python3 interpreter. The script ensures seamless execution by incorporating these checks and providing a reliable way to run Python code through a configurable environment variable.
<h5>1. Run inline</h5>

<code>1-run_inline:</code> Bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.
<h5>2. Hello, print</h5>

<code>2-print.py:</code> Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line using the function print.
<h5>3. Print integer</h5>

<code>3-print_number.py:</code> Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>4. Print float</h5>

<code>4-print_float.py:</code> Python script that prints the float stored in the variable number with a precision of two digits.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>5. Print string</h5>

<code>5-print_string.py:</code> Python script that prints a string stored in the variable str three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters contained in str, followed by another new line.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>6. Play with strings</h5>

<code>6-concat.py:</code> Python script that prints Welcome to Holberton School! using the variables str1 = "Holberton" and str2 = "School".
Completion of this source code.
<h5>7. Copy - Cut - Paste</h5>

<code>7-edges.py:</code> Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable word as follows:
word_first_3: Contains the first three letters of the variable word.
word_last_2: Contains the last two letters of the variable word.
middle_word: Contains the value of the variable word without the first and last letters.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>8. Create a new sentence</h5>

<code>8-concat_edges.py:</code> Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>9. Easter Egg</h5>

<code>9-easter_egg.py:</code> Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
<h5>10. Linked list cycle</h5>

<code>10-check_cycle.c:</code> C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
Returns 0 if there is no cycle and 1 if there is.
Helper files:
linked_lists.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 10-check_cycle.c (provided by Holberton School).
lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.
<h5>11. Hello, write</h5>

<code>100-write.py:</code> Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function write from the sys module.
Exits with a status code of 1.
<h5>12. Compile</h5>

<code>101-compile:</code> Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file $PYFILEc (ex. export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).
<h5>13. ByteCode -> Python #1</h5>

<code>102-magic_calculation.py:</code> Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
