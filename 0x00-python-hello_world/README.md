<h1>0x00 Python Hello World</h1>


In this undertaking, I started honing my skills with the Python interpreter, printing both text and variables, and exploring string indexing and slicing techniques.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<h5>0. Run Python File</h5>

0-run: Bash script that runs a Python script file saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.
<h5>1. Run inline</h5>

1-run_inline: Bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.
<h5>2. Hello, print</h5>

2-print.py: Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line using the function print.
<h5>3. Print integer</h5>

3-print_number.py: Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>4. Print float</h5>

4-print_float.py: Python script that prints the float stored in the variable number with a precision of two digits.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>5. Print string</h5>

5-print_string.py: Python script that prints a string stored in the variable str three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters contained in str, followed by another new line.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>6. Play with strings</h5>

6-concat.py: Python script that prints Welcome to Holberton School! using the variables str1 = "Holberton" and str2 = "School".
Completion of this source code.
<h5>7. Copy - Cut - Paste</h5>

7-edges.py: Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable word as follows:
word_first_3: Contains the first three letters of the variable word.
word_last_2: Contains the last two letters of the variable word.
middle_word: Contains the value of the variable word without the first and last letters.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>8. Create a new sentence</h5>

8-concat_edges.py: Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals.
Completion of this source code.
<h5>9. Easter Egg</h5>

9-easter_egg.py: Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
<h5>10. Linked list cycle</h5>

10-check_cycle.c: C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
Returns 0 if there is no cycle and 1 if there is.
Helper files:
linked_lists.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 10-check_cycle.c (provided by Holberton School).
lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.
<h5>11. Hello, write</h5>

100-write.py: Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function write from the sys module.
Exits with a status code of 1.
<h5>12. Compile</h5>

101-compile: Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file $PYFILEc (ex. export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).
<h5>13. ByteCode -> Python #1</h5>

102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
