<h1>0x00 Python Hello World</h1>


In this undertaking, I started honing my skills with the Python interpreter, printing both text and variables, and exploring string indexing and slicing techniques.

<h3>Tasks</h3>

Completion of this source code.
<b>4. Print float</b>

4-print_float.py: Python script that prints the float stored in the variable number with a precision of two digits.
Completion of this source code.
<b>5. Print string</b>

5-print_string.py: Python script that prints a string stored in the variable str three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters contained in str, followed by another new line.
Completion of this source code.
<b>6. Play with strings</b>

6-concat.py: Python script that prints Welcome to Holberton School! using the variables str1 = "Holberton" and str2 = "School".
Completion of this source code.
<b>7. Copy - Cut - Paste</b>

7-edges.py: Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable word as follows:
word_first_3: Contains the first three letters of the variable word.
word_last_2: Contains the last two letters of the variable word.
middle_word: Contains the value of the variable word without the first and last letters.
Completion of this source code.
<b>8. Create a new sentence</b>

8-concat_edges.py: Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals.
Completion of this source code.
<b>9. Easter Egg</b>

9-easter_egg.py: Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
<b>10. Linked list cycle</b>

10-check_cycle.c: C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
Returns 0 if there is no cycle and 1 if there is.
Helper files:
linked_lists.c: C functions handling linked lists for testing 10-check_cycle.c (provided by Holberton School).
lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.
<b>11. Hello, write</b>

100-write.py: Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function write from the sys module.
Exits with a status code of 1.
<b>12. Compile</b>

101-compile: Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file $PYFILEc (ex. export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc).
<b>13. ByteCode -> Python #1</b>

102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
